## Description of application

This is an application where we can see user profiles of a social network. In
it, we can follow a user and use a select option to filter those we are
following and those we are not following.

The card itself has a link to the user's tweets, and when hovered over, it is
highlighted in a different color

On the page of tweets, we see a limited number of them. The "Load more" button
will upload next batch of tweets. The "Back" button returns user to the Home
page.
